- **Situation:** In a health clinic, we attend to about 1000 patients, of which 268 have diabetes and 500 is Non Diabetic
  
- **Task:** Our mission was to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting diabetes cases with high precision and recall with Support Vector Machine.

- **Result:** With the deployment of our optimized model, we were able to identify 268 patients as potential diabetes cases and we can easily find anyone who is 
 diabetic with input array and it is very easy to find a person with diabetes thanks to our diabetes prediction model.
