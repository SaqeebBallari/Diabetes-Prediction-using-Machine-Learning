- **Situation:** In a health clinic, we attend to about 10,000 patients a month, of which 1,000 have diabetes. Before our project, only 150 of those cases were diagnosed in time for effective treatment.

- **Task:** Our mission was to develop a Machine Learning model capable of predicting diabetes cases with high precision and recall, aiming for early intervention and improved patient health management.

- **Action:** We decided to use an optimized XGBoost model for the task, due to its superior performance in classification tasks. After development, the model was implemented through a Gradio application, hosted on Hugging Face Spaces, making it accessible and easy to use by clinic staff.

- **Result:** With the deployment of our optimized model, we were able to identify 900 patients as potential diabetes cases, of which 750 actually had the disease and were diagnosed. This represented a significant increase in the detection of diabetes cases, jumping from only 150 diagnoses to 750, thanks to our diabetes prediction model.
